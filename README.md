About This Project :
  I used simple HTML and CSS to create my info page, show page and check page. AJAX is used in checl.html file to simply get something from what_you_want case in main.js file ( the last else in main.js code. check it! ). Mongodb is used to simply store data in our database. To create a server client platform I used Node JS.
